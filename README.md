<b>!!!WARNING!!!</b>
<br />This specific branch, "DexONEdirect", is highly experimental and will use slot 0x1 (reader) instead of 0x2 (smart). Solely introduced to test ONE-auth protocol on alt slot. Do <b>!!NOT!!</b> run this in any other circumstance with anything other than a ONE-transmitter and <i>especially not when using G6 + Pump as it will <u>disconnect</u> you from your pump.</i> You should <b>NOT</b> install this unless you've been asked to. Additionally, you shouldn't install this when you don't understand what it does + what its caveats are; not even when you've been asked to install it. The most important caveats are:
<br />1.) Note that even with the ONE: the connection to a (Dexcom) Receiver, if you're using one, may be severed or start causing issues. 
<br />2.) It is advisable to test this on another iPhone, because connecting one iPhone to two different slots on the transmitter may result in adverse effects <b>INCLUDING PERMANENTLY LOSING THE TRANSMITTER</b> (bricking it).
<br />3.) Again: do <b>NOT</b> run this with G6, <i>especially not</i> when you hooked it up to a pump (eg: T:Slim X2, Omnipod, Ypso).
<br /><br />This branch is solely for testing purposes with ONE-transmitters only and may be dangerous to run in any and all circumstances.
